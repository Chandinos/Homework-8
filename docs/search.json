Therefore, I subsetted the data to only include days in which the company was operational (FunctioningDay = “Yes”).\n\n\nSummarize the Data to have only One Observation per Day\nThe current data set records values on an hourly basis, so the data is going to be summarized in a way that each observation represents the counts and averages for the day. This will allows us to work with the data on a day by day basis, not hour by hour basis.\n\nDailyData &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(Date, Seasons, Holiday) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalBikeCount = sum(RentedBikeCount, na.rm = TRUE),\n    TotalRainfallMm = sum(RainfallMm, na.rm = TRUE),\n    TotalSnowfallCm = sum(SnowfallCm, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MeanTempC = mean(TemperatureC, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MeanHumidityPercent = mean(HumidityPercent, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MeanWindSpeedMs = mean(WindSpeedMS, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MeanVisibility10M = mean(Visibility10M, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MeanDewPointC = mean(DewPointTemperatureC, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MeanSolarMjm2 = mean(SolarRadiationMjM2, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n#Saving the New Data \nwrite.csv(DailyData, \"SeoulBikeDataDaily.csv\")\n\nThe new data set that we are going to work with contains 353 daily observations (as opposed to 8465 before) representing the 353 days out the year that the rental shop was open. It now contains summarized daily weather information and total daily rentals.\n\n\nExploring Relationships / Coorelations (using New Data Set)\nI am going to check the daily summaries using the new data set.

Specifically, Humidity vs Bike Rental Total, Trend over Over Time, Holiday Rentals vs Non-Holiday Rentals, & Temperature vs Rentals (Colored by Season)\n\n# Humidity vs Bike Rental Total \nggplot(DailyData, aes(x = MeanHumidityPercent, y = TotalBikeCount)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"cyan\") + \n  labs(title = \"Daily Bike Rentals vs Humidity\",\n       x = \"Mean Daily Humidity(%)\",\n       y = \"Total Daily Bike Rentals\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that there is not a strong relationship between humidity and daily bike rentals. The correlation is 0.04 along with the scatterplot leads up to conclude that humidity alone is not a driving force of consumer bike rental behavior.\n\n# Trend of Bike Rentals over Time\nggplot(DailyData, aes(x = Date, y = TotalBikeCount, color = Seasons)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Trend of Bike Rentals over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Total Daily Bike Rentals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, the daily trend over time shows rentals are low in the wintertime and then steadily increases through the spring into the summer. There is a small decline in late summer/early fall with a brief rebound in September/October before tapering off as winter approaches. Although there are clear fluctuations present, the overall trend is low bike rentals over the cold periods of the year and peak bike rentals occuring in the warm periods of the year.\n\n#Holiday vs Non-Holiday Bike Rentals\nggplot(DailyData, aes(x = Holiday, y = TotalBikeCount, fill = Holiday)) + geom_boxplot(aplha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Holiday vs Non-Holiday Bike Rentals\",\n       x = \"Holiday Status\",\n       y = \"Total Daily Bike Rentals\")\n\nWarning in geom_boxplot(aplha = 0.5): Ignoring unknown parameters: `aplha`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the boxplot above, we can see that there are noticeably less bike rentals on holidays than on days that are not considered holidays.\n\n#Temperature vs Rentals (Colored by Season)\nggplot(DailyData, aes(x = MeanTempC, y = TotalBikeCount, color = Seasons)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Temperature vs Bike Rentals (Colored by Season)\",\n       x = \"Mean Daily Temperature (Celsius)\",\n       y = \"Total Daily Bike Rentals\",\n       color = \"Season\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above displays a positive relationship between temperature and rentals. The higher the temperature, the more bike rentals there are. Summer has the most rentals but it appears as it gets extremely hot, the rentals decline. Overall, warmer months promote more people to rent bikes and colder months have lower demand for bike rentals.\n\n\n\nSplit the Data\n\n#For reproducibility\nset.seed(1234)\n\n#Split Data 75/25 (Stratified by Seasons)\nDailyDataSplit &lt;- initial_split(DailyData, prop = 0.75, strata = Seasons)\nTrainingData &lt;- training(DailyDataSplit)\nTestData &lt;- testing(DailyDataSplit)\n\n#Checking Overall Ratio\nnrow(TrainingData) / nrow(DailyData)\n\n[1] 0.7450425\n\nnrow(TestData) / nrow(DailyData)\n\n[1] 0.2549575\n\n#10-fold CV split\nCvFolds &lt;- vfold_cv(TrainingData, v = 10, strata = Seasons)\n\n#Checking the split balance for Training Data and Testing Data\nprop.table(table(TrainingData$Seasons))\n\n\n   Autumn    Spring    Summer    Winter \n0.2281369 0.2547529 0.2623574 0.2547529 \n\nprop.table(table(TestData$Seasons))\n\n\n   Autumn    Spring    Summer    Winter \n0.2333333 0.2555556 0.2555556 0.2555556 \n\n\n\n\nFitting MLR Models\n\nRecipe1: Creating Weekday/Weekend variable (factor), Normalizing Numeric Variables, Creating Dummy Variables\n\n#Creating Weekday/Weekend Factor Variable // Normalizing Numeric Variables // Creating Dummy Variables\nRecipe1 &lt;- recipe(TotalBikeCount ~ ., data = TrainingData) |&gt;\n  #Extracting day of the week\n  step_date(Date, features = \"dow\", label = TRUE) |&gt;\n  #Creating the weekday/weekend variable\n  step_mutate(\n    DayType = factor(if_else(Date_dow %in% c(\"Sat\", \"Sun\"), \"Weekend\", \"Weekday\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  #Removing Date and intermediate variable\n  step_rm(Date, Date_dow) |&gt;\n  #Removing columns that have no variation (these columns contribute nothing to the upcoming models)\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) |&gt;\n  #Normalizing the predictors (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1)\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) |&gt;\n  #Create dummy variables for Seasons, Holiday, and DayType\n  step_dummy(all_of(c(\"Seasons\", \"Holiday\", \"DayType\")))\n\n#Prepping and Baking\nRecipe1_Prep &lt;- prep(Recipe1)\nTrainingProcessed &lt;- bake(Recipe1_Prep, new_data = TrainingData)\nTestingProcessed &lt;- bake(Recipe1_Prep, new_data = TestData)\n\n#Quick Visual Check of Variables (No Date column // Dummy variables created // Numeric variables standardized)\nglimpse(TrainingProcessed)\n\nRows: 263\nColumns: 14\n$ TotalRainfallMm     &lt;dbl&gt;

The recipe that contains both the interactions as well as the squared terms had the best predictive accuracy of the three recipes. When the interactions were included in the model, there wasa big increase in predictive accuracy (Recipe 1: RMSE = 3895 / RSq = 0.850 vs Recipe 2: RMSE = 0.922 / RSq = 0.922). Although it appears insignificant, the accuracy of the model further improved when the quadratic terms were introduced. [Recipe 3 &gt; Recipe 2 &gt; Recipe 1 (in terms of predictive accuracy)]"
